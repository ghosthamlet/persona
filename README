## Open domain persona-aware dialogue generation

Code quality is low, just can be used for experiments, implemented four papers about open domain persona-aware dialogue generation:


Improvement of a dedicated model for open domain persona-aware dialogue generation (): AttentionRoutingPlus/

A Pre-training Based Personalized Dialogue Generation Model with Persona-sparse Data (http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04700): AttentionRouting/

Personalized Dialogue Generation with Diversified Traits (http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09672): PersonalityTraitFusion/

Assigning personality/identity to a chatting machine for coherent conversation generation (http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02861): AssignPersonality/

The last two papers code still have problems.

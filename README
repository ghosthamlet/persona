## Open domain persona-aware dialogue generation

This codebase implemented four papers about open domain persona-aware dialogue generation, Code quality is low, just can be used for experiments:

Improvement of a dedicated model for open domain persona-aware dialogue generation (): AttentionRoutingPlus/
(Please contact zhengyinhe1@163.com for the PersonalDialog dataset)

A Pre-training Based Personalized Dialogue Generation Model with Persona-sparse Data (http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04700): AttentionRouting/
(Please contact zhengyinhe1@163.com for the PersonalDialog dataset)

Personalized Dialogue Generation with Diversified Traits (http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09672): PersonalityTraitFusion/
(Please contact zhengyinhe1@163.com for the PersonalDialog dataset)

Assigning personality/identity to a chatting machine for coherent conversation generation (http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02861): AssignPersonality/
(Personality Assignment dataset: http://coai.cs.tsinghua. edu.cn/hml/dataset/#AssignPersonality)

The first two papers code tested on ubuntu16.10 and python3.6.10.

The last two papers code still have problems for training , don't use them.
